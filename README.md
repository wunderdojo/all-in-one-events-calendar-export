Add on to the WordPress All in One Event Calendar by Time.ly that allows exporting events to Word, OpenDoc, text and other formats. Filter events to be exported by date range and, optionally, category.

This add on was created for a single client and makes certain assumptions (ex: that All in One Event Calendar is already installed). It is a very simple tool with limited options but would make an easy jumping off point for anyone with the need to do something similar.
